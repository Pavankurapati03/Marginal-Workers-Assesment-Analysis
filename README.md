## Project Motivation

The project involves analyzing the demographic characteristics of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu based on their age, industrial category, and sex. The objective is to perform a socioeconomic analysis and create visualizations to represent the distribution of marginal workers across different categories. This project includes defining objectives, designing the analysis approach, selecting appropriate visualization types, and performing the analysis using Python and data visualization libraries.

## Data

The catalog contains data related to Marginal Workers Classified by Age, Industrial Category, and Sex - Census 2011. It includes data on Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Marginal Workers, and Industrial Workers during Census 2011.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** First, data related to marginal workers in Tamil Nadu is gathered. This includes information on their employment, Age, Industrial Category, and Sex - Census 2011.

2. **Data Processing:** The collected data is organized and cleaned to remove errors. This makes it easier to work with.

3. **Data Analysis:** Various statistical techniques are used to find patterns and insights in the data. This helps understand the socioeconomic conditions of marginal workers.

4. **Interpretation:** The analyzed data is interpreted to draw conclusions about the status of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu. This might involve looking at factors like poverty, education, and employment.

5. **Reporting:** The findings are presented in a report. This report explains the socioeconomic situation of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu and suggests potential improvements or interventions.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for interactive visualizations. You can install them using the following commands:

- `!pip install numpy`
- `!pip install pandas`

2. **Development Environment:** Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Tools:** Data Visualization tools (Matplotlib and Seaborn), Spreadsheet (MS Excel) tools, etc.
4. **Libraries and Packages:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn are the libraries used to analyze the data and find hidden patterns and insights.
5. **Coding Standards and Style:** All code standards, including formatting, spacing, comments, naming conventions, and indentation, are followed.
6. **Data Sources:** The data for this project is collected from the government site: [Data Source](https://tn.data.gov.in/catalog/marginal-workers-classified-age-industrial-category-and-sex-census-2011-india-and-states)
	## Data Analysis and Visualization

In order to comprehend the data's hidden patterns and insights, we have applied demographic analysis to this project. Demographic analysis is the study of populations and the traits that make them up. It entails analyzing a range of demographic variables that characterize and explain the distribution, composition, and fluctuations within a population. In this project, we explore the distribution of the population by age group and gender, analyze the urban-rural distribution within different age groups, examine the distribution of the population in different areas, and more.

We have utilized the Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries to create a variety of data visualizations, including bar charts, stacked bar charts, grouped bar charts, heatmaps, and more, for the purpose of data analysis.

### Key Analyses from the Three Datasets:

- Calculated the urban and rural population across different industries categories.
- Identified the highest and lowest urban and rural population across different industries categories.
- Analyzed the urban and rural population for employment durations by gender.
- Examined the population of work duration and gender from different areas.
- Studied the population of work duration and gender in different age groups.
- Investigated the number of workers in different industries by area name.
- Explored the number of workers in different industries by age group.
- Conducted correlational analysis between various variables related to industrial categories, urban/rural areas, and gender.

To aid in comprehending the data, we have visualized all of this information using various charts. As a result, we can make the necessary deductions and complete the report.



## Sample Outputs

1. **Urban Population across Different Industries**

   We have calculated the urban population across different industries. We have a total of three datasets, including the entire Tamil Nadu dataset, SC dataset, and ST dataset. This is a sample output of our interactive visualization techniques.

   ![Sample Output 1](https://github.com/Pavankurapati03/Gold_Price_Prediction/assets/124707043/d8a662b5-1d87-4480-a739-3329192560b3)

2. **Rural Population across Different Industries**

   As well as urban population, we have also calculated the rural population across different industries.

3. **Urban Population for Employment Durations by Gender**

   We have calculated the urban population for employment durations (more than 3 months, less than 6 months, or less than 3 months) by gender (Persons, Male, Female).
